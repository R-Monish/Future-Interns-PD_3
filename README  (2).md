Key Features

1.User Input for Game Selection:-The program allows the user to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors. This input is captured and stored in the user_choice variable, enabling the user to actively participate in the game.

2.Random Choice for the Computer:-The program uses the random.randint(0, 2) function to generate a random choice for the computer. This randomization ensures that the game is fair and unpredictable, as the computer's choice will be different each time the game is played.

3.Input Validation:-The program includes a check to ensure that the user's input is valid (i.e., 0, 1, or 2). If the user inputs a number outside this range, the program detects it as an invalid choice and informs the user that they lose by default. This feature prevents the game from proceeding with invalid inputs.

4.Conditional Logic for Game Outcomes:-The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the outcome of the game based on the user's choice and the computer's choice. It checks all possible outcomes, such as winning, losing, or drawing, and prints the corresponding result, ensuring accurate game logic.

5.Clear Outcome Display:- The program provides immediate feedback to the user by printing whether they won, lost, or drew the game. This clear and direct feedback enhances the user experience by making the result of each round easy to understand
